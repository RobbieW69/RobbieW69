For the most part I wasn't able to play video games much before I was 18, with Pokemon being the only exception as I had saved enough money from birthday cards ect to buy a Nintendo DS Lite when I was 13/14 and my grandma getting me Soul Silver. Other than that I had the original Xbox and played alot of Shadow The Hedgehog, but since we didn't have internet that was all I was able to do.    

Once I got my first job I bought the parts for this PC and put it together and downloaded Steam, from there I gained all the hours above.    

At the moment I like to work on modding 7 Days to Die and have been doing so for a while, I also host DnD on Wednesday evenings at 7:30pm CST, chat and game with friends on Discord, and sometimes stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/robbiew1337) and enjoy life.
