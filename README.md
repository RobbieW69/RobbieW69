### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹    

The name's Robbie, 24, just your average gamer. Programmer. Modder. Enjoyer of most things technology related.     

I play many games, to name a few of my top though I would say;    
+ Overwatch (3k+ Hours)    
+ 7 Days to Die (1800+ Hours) (Modded)     
+ Arma II Operation Arrowhead: DayZ Mod (700+ Hours) (Modded)     
+ Pokemon: Soul Silver (2k+ Hours)      
+ Dungeons & Dragons (1k+ Hours)      
+ Attack on Titan Tribute Game by Fenglee (2500+ Hours) (Modded)       
+ YuGiOh via YGOPRO(ProjectIgnis) and IRL cards (500+ Hours)     
+ Counter Strike: Global Offensive (300+ Hours)      
+ Elsword (500+ Hours)     
+ Brawlhalla (500+ Hours)      
+ GTA:V (100+ Hours)      
+ SCP: Secret Labratory (500+ Hours) (Modded)          

For the most part I wasn't able to play video games much before I was 18, with Pokemon being the only exception as I had saved enough money from birthday cards ect to buy a Nintendo DS Lite when I was 13/14 and my grandma getting me Soul Silver. Other than that I had the original Xbox and played alot of Shadow The Hedgehog, but since we didn't have internet that was all I was able to do.    

Once I got my first job I bought the parts for this PC and put it together and downloaded Steam, from there I gained all the hours above.    

At the moment I like to work on modding 7 Days to Die and have been doing so for a while, I also host DnD on Wednesday evenings at 7:30pm CST, chat and game with friends on Discord, and sometimes stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/robbiew1337) and enjoy life.
